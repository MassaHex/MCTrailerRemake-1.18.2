This mod allows mobs, items, and so much more to break in realistic ways, unlike Minecraft's bad logic.

### Visuality : <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/visuality">https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/visuality</a>
This mod is similar to Effective but does not focus on the ocean and focuses more on mobs, and ores.
